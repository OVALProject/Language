# Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Element Dictionary

* Schema: Independent Definition  
* Version: 5.11.1:1.2  
* Release Date: 11/30/2016 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the tests found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) that are independent of a specific piece of software. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at http://oval.cisecurity.org.

## <a name="family_test"></a>< family_test >

The family_test element is used to check the family a certain system belongs to. This test basically allows the high level system types (window, unix, ios, etc.) to be tested. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a family_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

**Extends:** [oval-def:TestType](oval-definitions-schema.md#TestType) 

| Child Elements | Type (MinOccurs..MaxOccurs) |  
|:-------------- |:--------------------------- |  
| object | [oval-def:ObjectRefType](oval-definitions-schema.md#ObjectRefType)  (1..1) |  
|||  
| state | [oval-def:StateRefType](oval-definitions-schema.md#StateRefType)  (0..unbounded) |  
|||  
  
## <a name="family_object"></a>< family_object >

The family_object element is used by a family test to define those objects to evaluate based on a specified state. There is actually only one object relating to family and this is the system as a whole. Therefore, there are no child entities defined. Any OVAL Test written to check the family will reference the same family_object which is basically an empty object element.

**Extends:** [oval-def:ObjectType](oval-definitions-schema.md#ObjectType) 

## <a name="family_state"></a>< family_state >

The family_state element contains a single entity that is used to check the family associated with the system. The family is a high-level classification of system types.

**Extends:** [oval-def:StateType](oval-definitions-schema.md#StateType) 

| Child Elements | Type (MinOccurs..MaxOccurs) |  
|:-------------- |:--------------------------- |  
| family | [ind-def:EntityStateFamilyType](#EntityStateFamilyType)  (0..1) |  
||<div>This element describes the high-level system OS type to test against. Please refer to the definition of the EntityFamilyType for more information about the possible values..</div>|

> :small_red_triangle: **Deprecated As Of Version 5.8** :small_red_triangle: <br />**Reason:** Replaced by the filehash58_test.<br />**Comment:** This object has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version of the language.<br />

The file hash test is used to check the hashes associated with a specified file. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a filehash_object and the optional state element specifies the different hashes to check.

**Extends:** [oval-def:TestType](oval-definitions-schema.md#TestType)

The filehash_object element is used by a file hash test to define the specific file(s) to be evaluated. The filehash_object will only collect regular files on UNIX systems and FILE_TYPE_DISK files on Windows systems. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

A filehash_object defines the path and filename of the file(s). In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the FileBehaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.

The set of files to be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these options may be selected.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

## <a name="LdapBehaviors"></a>== LdapBehaviors ==

The LdapBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the ldap_object being specified.

#### Attributes:

*	**scope** Restriction of xsd:string (optional -- default='BASE') ('BASE', 'ONE', 'SUBTREE')  
'scope' defines the depth from the base distinguished name to which the search should occur. The base distinguished name is the starting point of the search and is composed of the specified suffix and relative distinguished name. A value of 'BASE' indicates to search only the entry at the base distinguished name, a value of 'ONE' indicates to search all entries one level under the base distinguished name - but NOT including the base distinguished name, and a value of 'SUBTREE' indicates to search all entries at all levels under, and including, the specified base distinguished name. The default value is 'BASE'.

The set of files to be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these options may be selected.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

||<div>The pattern entity defines a chunk of text in a file and is represented using a regular expression. A subexpression (using parentheses) can call out a piece of the text block to test. For example, the pattern `abc(.*)xyz` would look for a block of text in the file that starts with abc and ends with xyz, with the subexpression being all the characters that exist in between. The value of the subexpression can then be tested using the subexpression entity of a textfilecontent54_state. Note that if the pattern, starting at the same point in the file, matches more than one block of text, then it matches the longest. For example, given a file with abcdefxyzxyzabc, then the pattern `abc(.*)xyz` would match the block abcdefxyzxyz. Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings, subject to the constraint that the whole match be as long as possible, with subexpressions starting earlier in the pattern taking priority over ones starting later.</div><div>Note that when using regular expressions, OVAL supports a common subset of the regular expression character classes, operations, expressions and other lexical tokens defined within Perl 5's regular expression specification.

The first match is given an instance value of 1, the second match is given an instance value of 2, and so on. For positive values, the 'less than' and 'less than or equals' operations imply the the object is operating only on positive values. Frequently, this entity will be defined as 'greater than or equals' 1, which results in the object representing the set of all matches of the pattern.</div><div>Negative values are used to simplify collection of pattern match occurrences counting backwards from the last match. To find the last match, use an instance of -1; the penultimate match is found using an instance value of -2, and so on. For negative values, the 'greater than' and 'greater than or equals' operations imply the object is operating only on negative values. For example, searching for instances greater than or equal to -2 would yield only the last two maches.</div><div>Note that the main purpose of the instance item entity is to provide uniqueness for different textfilecontent_items that results from multiple matches of a given pattern against the same file, and they will always have positive values.</div>|

## <a name="Textfilecontent54Behaviors"></a>== Textfilecontent54Behaviors ==

The Textfilecontent54Behaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the textfilecontent54_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

The Textfilecontent54Behaviors extend the ind-def:FileBehaviors and therefore include the behaviors defined by that type.

**Extends:** [ind-def:FileBehaviors](#FileBehaviors) 

#### Attributes:

*	**ignore_case** xsd:boolean (optional -- default='false')  
'ignore_case' indicates whether case should be considered when matching system values against the regular expression provided by the pattern entity. This behavior is intended to align with the Perl regular expression 'i' modifier: if true, case will be ignored. If false, case will not be ignored. The default is false.  
*	**multiline** xsd:boolean (optional -- default='true')  
'multiline' enables multiple line semantics in the regular expression provided by the pattern entity. This behavior is intended to align with the Perl regular expression 'm' modifier: if true, the '^' and '$' metacharacters will match both at the beginning/end of a string, and immediately after/before newline characters. If false, they will match only at the beginning/end of a string. The default is true.  
*	**singleline** xsd:boolean (optional -- default='false')  
'singleline' enables single line semantics in the regular expression provided by the pattern entity. This behavior is intended to align with the Perl regular expression 's' modifier: if true, the '.' metacharacter will match newlines. If false, it will not. The default is false.

## <a name="textfilecontent_state"></a><  ~~textfilecontent_state~~  >

> :small_red_triangle: **Deprecated As Of Version 5.4** :small_red_triangle: <br />**Reason:** Replaced by the textfilecontent54_state. Support for multi-line pattern matching and multi-instance matching was added. Therefore, a new state was created to reflect these changes. See the textfilecontent54_state.<br />**Comment:** This state has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.<br />

The textfilecontent_state element contains entities that are used to check the file path and name, as well as the line in question and the value of the specific subexpression.

## <a name="unknown_test"></a>< unknown_test >

An unknown_test acts as a placeholder for tests whose implementation is unknown. This test always evaluates to a result of 'unknown'. Any information that is known about the test should be held in the notes child element that is available through the extension of the abstract test element. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. Note that for an unknown_test, the required check attribute that is part of the extended TestType should be ignored during evaluation and hence can be set to any valid value.

## <a name="xmlfilecontent_object"></a>< xmlfilecontent_object >

The xmlfilecontent_object element is used by a xml file content test to define the specific piece of an xml file(s) to be evaluated. The xmlfilecontent_object will only collect regular files on UNIX systems and FILE_TYPE_DISK files on Windows systems. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

The set of files to be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these options may be selected.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

## <a name="FileBehaviors"></a>== FileBehaviors ==

The FileBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of a set of files or file related items to collect. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

#### Attributes:

*	**max_depth** Restriction of xsd:integer (optional -- default='-1')  
'max_depth' defines the maximum depth of recursion to perform when a recurse_direction is specified. A value of '0' is equivalent to no recursion, '1' means to step only one directory level up/down, and so on. The default value is '-1' meaning no limitation. For a 'max_depth' of -1 or any value of 1 or more the starting directory must be considered in the recursive search.  
Note that the default recurse_direction behavior is 'none' so even though max_depth specifies no limitation by default, the recurse_direction behavior turns recursion off.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
*	**recurse** Restriction of xsd:string (optional -- default='symlinks and directories') ('directories', 'symlinks', 'symlinks and directories')  
'recurse' defines how to recurse into the path entity, in other words what to follow during recursion. Options include symlinks, directories, or both. Note that a max-depth other than 0 has to be specified for recursion to take place and for this attribute to mean anything. Also note that on Windows, the 'symlink' value is equivalent to the 'junction' recurse value in win-def:FileBehaviors.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
*	**recurse_direction** Restriction of xsd:string (optional -- default='none') ('none', 'up', 'down')  
'recurse_direction' defines the direction to recurse, either 'up' to parent directories, or 'down' into child directories. The default value is 'none' for no recursion.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
*	**recurse_file_system** Restriction of xsd:string (optional -- default='all') ('all', 'local', 'defined')  
'recurse_file_system' defines the file system limitation of any searching and applies to all operations as specified on the path or filepath entity. The value of 'local' limits the search scope to local file systems (as opposed to file systems mounted from an external system). The value of 'defined' keeps any recursion within the file system that the file_object (path+filename or filepath) has specified. For example, on Windows, if the path specified was "C:\", you would search only the C: drive, not other filesystems mounted to descendant paths. Similarly, on UNIX, if the path specified was "/", you would search only the filesystem mounted there, not other filesystems mounted to descendant paths. The value of 'defined' only applies when an equality operation is used for searching because the path or filepath entity must explicitly define a file system. The default value is 'all' meaning to search all available file systems for data collection.  
Note that in most cases it is recommended that the value of 'local' be used to ensure that file system searching is limited to only the local file systems. Searching 'all' file systems may have performance implications.  
*	**windows_view** Restriction of xsd:string (optional -- default='64_bit') ('32_bit', '64_bit')  
64-bit versions of Windows provide an alternate file system and registry views to 32-bit applications. This behavior allows the OVAL Object to specify which view should be examined. This behavior only applies to 64-bit Windows, and must not be applied on other platforms.  
Note that the values have the following meaning: '64_bit' – Indicates that the 64-bit view on 64-bit Windows operating systems must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. '32_bit' – Indicates that the 32-bit view must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. It is recommended that the corresponding 'windows_view' entity be set on the OVAL Items that are collected when this behavior is used to distinguish between the OVAL Items that are collected in the 32-bit or 64-bit views.
